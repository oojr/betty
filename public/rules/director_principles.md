# Betty's Video Direction Principles

1. High Performance: All Remotion components should be optimized for frame-perfect rendering.
2. Motion Curves: Use spring-based animations for natural movement unless linear is specified.
3. Code Generation: Ensure all generated code is self-contained or uses standard Remotion/React libraries.
4. Error Correction: If a build fails, analyze the WebContainer stdout immediately and apply fixes to the VFS.
5. Gemini 3 Orchestration: Always maintain the thoughtSignature in the conversation context.
